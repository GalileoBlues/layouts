Hands up came to be because I wanted a layout that focuses almost entirely on inrolls and low redirects.
<a href="https://github.com/semilin/genkey">Genkey</a> was the perfect tool to get a rough idea for
this, starting from a `nrst` and `hiea` homerow it was able to get good columns
very quickly, I didn't really handmake a lot of this.

Inevitably this was to the cost of some patterns like
`cr`, `fi`, `pr` and `gl`. It also has higher dsfbs than you
might find on other layouts, though keep in mind about 0.8% of this can be attributed to the
`oe` column. was mostly index reordering and getting rid of `pnb` on pinky, which
was something genkey liked a lot but is obviously not good in practice.

With this I got a layout with a _lot_ of inrolls, something which I hadn't really seen anywhere
else. Later I did find out that it's only a handful of swaps away from balance-12, a fact I was
completely oblivious of until much later.


While redirects are low in total, the ones it has are generally pretty terrible: try typing
`before` on this for example. There are far more weird patterns than I anticipated, and for
this reason I wouldn't recommend it over many other layouts currently out there.

What I will say is that having `n` on consonant hand pinky does show a lot of potential and I
will definitely explore this further since it gives very good redirects and inrolls, to the detriment of
basically nothing. Hands up with its pinky on index and a semimak-like vowel setup would already be a
step at solving some of its current issues for example while keeping the insane inrolls on consonant
hand.

Another thing I noticed about `hiea` homerow layouts is that punctuation is always really
nicely accessible, which can be very useful. Something I don't like is how things like `.`
and `,` can be really far away or on the same fingers as I do all other punct and numbers
with, an issue which these layouts don't have.
