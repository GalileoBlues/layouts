Crest is a layout I created because I was very impressed by the roll stats of Rollmak and Megamak. I
especially thought the homerow was interesting because it seemed to be possible to stay fairly
close to Colemak while solving a lot of the redirect issues it has.

This I did not end up doing as Rollmak seemed to fill this role quite nicely. Instead, I tried to build
on top of Rollmak and improve what was already there.

My main goal was to keep weird patterns low, sometimes even to the
detriment to some finger balance. Besides pinkies, both hand and finger balance were the least of my concerns
while making this layout. Redirects I also cared less about, a change of pace from what I usually make. Last
but not least is `n` on vowel index for the rolls that I wanted, curious to how that would work out compared to
simply putting it on index.


This might be the most polished layout I have. Besides the redirects with `n` there is very little I can point to
that I don't like. There is `wr`, but that's about it. Pinkies are good, patterns are good, I'm really happy with
the result. There are however 3 pairs that you might want to consider swapping, depending on what you like.

`bj` is a good swap candidate, I might actually make that the main layout, I'm not entirely sure. `b` is where it
is currently because `be` and `ba` would not be great and from here those become slightly easier. This is a rowstag
consideration though, on colstag definitely swap those.

The other pair is `gw`. The current setup allows for a much easier `gl` than would otherwise be possible, moving
some sfbs from index to ring in the process. There is however value in swapping those back, making `gl` worse but
moving sfbs off of ring. I will say though that ring already doesn't have much to do, so a potentially slidable
`sw` is certainly not the end of the world.

Lastly you can consider a `,'w` cycle. This gets rid of `wr` which is great, but does leave you with `'` being in
a bit of an awkward position, especially in something like `you'` this could be a problem. Still, it might be
something to consider especially if you don't/can't slide `e,` which is surprisingly common.

Speaking of work, this layout is pretty unbalanced. It's got a 45-55 workload, which means one hand will be
working harder than the other, and it's got some interesting finger balances. Left index is about 18% use, while
left middle and ring are both about 10%. Right ring is nearing 17% while right middle is about 16%, with index
being just over 15%. You might want to consider this before starting out. It shouldn't affect your experience too
much, but it's something to keep in mind. If you want to ease up on right ring (to the detriment of right pinky)
you can swap `.` and `;`.

In the end you get a layout very similar to Hands Left, something which I'm very happy with. Go try this!
